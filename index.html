        <h1>London</h1>
        <p>
            London is the capital of Great Britain, its political, economic and cultural centre. <br>
            It's one of the largest cities in the world. Its population is more than million people.  <br>
            London is situated on the river Thames. The city is very old and beautiful.  <br>
            It was founded more than two thousand years ago.  <br>
            Traditionally London is divided into several parts: the City, the West End,  <br>
            the East End and Westminster. The City is the oldest part of London,  <br>
            its financial and business centre. The heart of the City is the Stock Exchange.  <br>
            Westminster is the most important part of the capital. It's the administrative centre.  <br>
            The Houses of Parliament, the seat of the British Government, are there.  <br>
            It's a very beautiful building with two towers and a very big clock called Big Ben.  <br>
            Big Ben is really the bell which strikes every quarter of an hour.  <br>
            Opposite the Houses of Parliament is Westminster Abbey.  <br>
            It's a very beautiful church built over 900 years ago.  <br>
            The tombs of many great statesmen, scientists and writers are there. <br>

        <h2>West End</h2>
        <p>
            To the west of Westminster is West End. Here we find most of the big shops, hotels, <br>
            museums, art galleries, theatres and concert halls. Picadilly Circus is the heart of <br>
            London's West End. In the West End there are wide streets with beautiful houses and many parks, <br>
            gardens and squares. To the east of Westminster is the East End, an industrial district of the <br>
            capital. There are no parks or gardens in the East End and you can't see many fine houses there. <br>
            Most of the plants and factories are situated there <br>
